This project was created with Expo https://expo.io

It implements a couple APIs and featrures that are available in the react native community. This repo is missing the ios and android folders that are present with the conventional React Native app.

The goal here is to implement the app as a pure react native project.

Please do not push to this repository or make any new branches. Simply clone it or just use as a guide line for implementing your own solution.

Once completed, please share your solutions for review, through github.
